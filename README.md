# Introduction:
In this project, the goal was to visualize earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in a meaningful way using Leaflet. The USGS collects large amounts of data on earthquakes around the world on a daily basis but needed a way to better display the data to the public and other organizations. The project was divided into two parts, with the first part involving creating a basic map that plots all the earthquakes from a selected dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

# Project Overview:
The project involved using Leaflet, HTML, and JavaScript to import and visualize earthquake data provided in a JSON format. The data markers on the map were colored and sized according to the magnitude and depth of the earthquake, with pop-ups providing additional information when the markers are clicked. A legend was also included to provide context for the map data.

# What I Did:
I created a basic map using Leaflet and imported the earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page using JavaScript. I then used the longitude and latitude coordinates of each earthquake to plot them on the map, with the size and color of each marker indicating the magnitude and depth of the earthquake. I also included pop-ups that display additional information about each earthquake when the markers are clicked. Lastly, I created a legend to provide context for the map data.

# Tools Used:
* Leaflet
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

# What I Learned:
Through this project, I learned how to use Leaflet to create maps and display data in a visually appealing and informative way. I also gained experience in working with JSON data, handling errors, and using JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project allowed me to gain valuable experience in working with Leaflet and JavaScript to visualize earthquake data. By completing this project, I was able to create a map that not only displays the data in an informative way but also adds context to the data through the use of a legend.
